# Porfolio
This page represents an array of projects I have completed while attending the XC Academy at Humana. It also represents an understanding. 
I am thankful for my teachers, contemporaries, mentor, and all involved in organizing this curriculum. I have found an interest
that excites me while simultaneously compelling me to become better. This is only the beginning.
