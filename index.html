                <h2 style="font-style: italic;">Software Engineer</h2>
                <div>
                    Software engineer with a passion for the Arts. I am a graduate of Highland Springs High School. I
                    attended Reynolds Community College to persue my interest in Music Recording Technology, learning
                    the fundementals of this disipline fascinated me. I enjoy drawing,
                    playing guitar, biking and nature walks. In 2019, I was presented with the opportunity to take a
                    course offered by Tech Louisville. My goal was to complete the course to gain access to a new field
                    of employment, the field of Computer Science. I completed the course in five months receiving a
                    certificate from Google as an Information Technology Support Professional.

                <div>
                    Soon after completion, I became gainfully employed by Compucom as an IT Service Desk Support Agent.
                    I received incoming calls, diagnosed and troubleshot end-user desktop application issues, and
                    provided an appropriate solution. I also supported end-users in their use of applications such as
                    Microsoft Office, VPN, Citrix, and MDM. I performed account management and maintenance for various
                    applications and systems (e.g., creating or modifying user accounts and permissions, and performing
                    password resets).

                <div>

                    While employed at Compucom, I was presented with an opportunity to learn more new skills. Through
                    AMPED I was
                    accepted as a Data Analyst Immersive Fellow. Here I was introduced to Python, Tableau, PowerBI, and
                    other applications used in data analysis. I presented my Capstone project, using data, to show how
                    the police presence in certain neighborhoods directly correlates to increased
                    incarceration rates in those same neighborhoods.

                <div>

                    Desiring more knowledge, I learned of XC Academy. XC Academy is a contemporary, human-centered
                    technology
                    curriculum that teaches students how to code. I applied and was graciously accepted as an intern
                    working
                    for Humana. Here, I have become a Full-Stack engineer. I found my niche. I enjoy the problem-solving
                    as well as the creative aspect of software engineering. I am excited to become a part of a team
                    where I get to use my skill set in building production software. I am dedicated to this field,
                    continued learning, and growth. I am confident I can become an asset to any organization.
