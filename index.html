                <div>
                    Software engineer with a passion for the Arts. I enjoy drawing, jamming on guitar, and nature walks.
                    To gain access to a new field of employment, I enrolled in a course offered by Tech Louisville in
                    late 2019. After five months of dedication, I achieved a certificate from Google as an Information
                    Technology Support Professional.
                    Upon completion, I became employed by Compucom as an IT Service Desk Support Agent. My
                    responsibilities were receiving incoming calls, and troubleshooting end-user application issues, I
                    also performed account management and maintenance for applications, such as Microsoft Office, VPN,
                    Citrix, and MDM systems.
                    While employed at Compucom, AMPED provided the next opportunity for growth. Accepted as a Data
                    Analyst Immersive Fellow by General Assembly, I created projects using Python, Tableau, PowerBI,
                    and other applications used by Data Analyst. 
                     Through the XCA, a contemporary technology curriculum that teaches students how to code, I became a
                    full-stack engineer working for Humana. Puzzle-solving, creativity, and ingenuity are
                    all elements of software engineering that I love. It is exciting to code. I have found my niche.
                    I have a strong desire to become part of a diverse team and use my fresh skill set to build
                    purposeful next-level software. I am dedicated to the field of Computer Science, developing as an
                    engineer, continued learning, and growth.
